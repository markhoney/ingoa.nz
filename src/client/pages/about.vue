			<i>Ngā Ingoa o Aotearoa</i> (The Names of New Zealand) is probably the first "pronouncing dictionary" that is literally "pronouncing". The 8,200 names are spoken by 132 native speakers of Māori, chosen by each other as the best speakers for their areas.
		</p>
		<p>
			They include such famous names as John Rangihau, Wiremu Parker, Bill Kere Kere, Ruka Broughton, Eruera Manuera, Tupi Puriri, Magda Wallscott, Island Love, and Matenga Baker. Mainly elders, most of the speakers have since died. Because they say only names in their own areas, local accents are automatically accommodated.
		</p>
		<p>
			The list includes geographic features down to the larger hills and streams, all human settlements, suburbs and schools, marae, meeting houses and dining halls and many other features. The South Island volume includes the original Māori names of many features now known by English ones.
		</p>
		<p>
			The names are sorted into 177 clearly defined "Zones", and are in alphabetical order within each Zone, so that any name can be found quickly. Booklets for each region index the names alphabetically and by Zone, and a map of the Zones is enclosed with each cassette. The dictionary is intended especially for broadcasters and those who have to speak in public, but everyone who wants to pronounce placenames as Māori words will find it valuable.

			Hugh Young took ten years of his spare time recording and editing the dictionary, after securing the approval of trust boards and tribal authorities throughout the country. He made two tours of the lower North Island in 1984 to record Part 1, untold forays into the north in 1986-90 to record Part 2, and two journeys the length of the South Island in 1992 and 1993 to record Part 3.
		</p>
		<p>
			The dictionary does not give the names' meanings. That would take more than a lifetime, and would be done better by Māori in each area, since meanings involve mana and tapu to a much greater extent.
