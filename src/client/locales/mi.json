	"intro": "The pages of this website are not the dictionary. The audio recordings are the dictionary. The pages are just a guide to the recorded words. They are a dictionary of the pronunciations of placenames only, not their meanings. The places are sorted into \"Zones\", and each Zone is about the size of a county. They are divided by tribe and also along lines of convenience. To distinguish the Zones from the places, the Zones have English names, \"where such have been bestowed.\"",
	"disclaimer": "Just because a name has been put in a particular Zone, or is spoken by a particular person, that does not mean I claim that the place belongs to any particular people. That is not what this dictionary is for, but every name had to be assigned to somebody.",
