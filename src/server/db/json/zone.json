Elders asked him to spell it with the H, and the game was afoot. It arose again when the official spelling of the river and region was being considered in 2009. (It wss then that I hit on the superscript <sup>h</sup> as a way of cutting the Gordian knot.) Currently either spelling is officially acceptable. Attempting to pronounce the H has played havoc with the pronunciation by non-speakers of Māori. The local Māori pronunciation leaves the H almost (but not quite) silent, and the common pronunciation (and hence spelling) with no H at all was a near-approximation.
