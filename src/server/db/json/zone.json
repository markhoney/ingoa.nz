(It wss then that I hit on the superscript <sup>h</sup> as a way of cutting the Gordian knot.) Currently either spelling is officially acceptable. Attempting to pronounce the H has played havoc with the pronunciation by non-speakers of Māori. The local Māori pronunciation leaves the H almost (but not quite) silent, and the common pronunciation (and hence spelling) with no H at all was a near-approximation.
