We recorded in Gisborne, saving me a long trip up the coast.
	Arapera Mikaera Rangimauriora Nitenetara (Governor)			F				Arapera Mikaera Rangimauriora Nitenetara	Arapera	Mikaera Rangimauriora	Nitenetara	Governor		her home		Arapera Nitenetara	Mrs Governor was blind, and I read each name for her to repeat/correct, then edited my own voice out.

	Charles Solomon			M					Charles		Solomon			his home		Charles Solomon	Chartes Solomon was the son of Tommy Solomon, the last "full blooded" Moriori of the Chatham Islands. I included him more for his historical importance, with the help of his son Māui Solomon, since he did not speak the Moriori language. It has since undergone a revival. He was blind and I read him each name. He lived in Temuka, and he gave me some sense of what it meant to say the Moriori died "of despair". 
	Dan Pomana			M					Dan		Pomana			his home		Dan Pomana	
	Derek Asher			M					Derek		Asher			his home		Derek Asher	
	Eddie Matehaere			M					Eddie		Matehaere			his home		Eddie Matehaere

	John Henry Bird, QSO in Apa-hapai-taketake			M					John	Henry	Bird	QSO	Apa-hapai-taketake	Apa-hapai-taketake		John Bird	We recorded in the meeting house, and some women were weaving at the other end. I asked if they could stop, but Mr Bird said, no, their work is tapu too.
	John Rangihau			M					John		Rangihau		Studio 1 of Broadcasting House, Bowen St, Wellington, of treasured memory (now replaced by a brick banana)	Studio 1, Broadcasting House, Bowen St, Wellington	https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/5r6/rangihau-john-te-rangianiwaniwa	John Rangihau	I had known John Rangihou since 1971 and of course he was best qualified to speak for Ngai Tūhoe. It was only by chance that I recorded Waimana without him. It took months to find us both free. We recorded in Studio 1 of Broadcasting House of blessed memory. You can hear his love of the places in his voice. (This is true of many other speakers as well).
	John Tangiora			M					John		Tangiora			his home		John Tangiora	I recorded John Tangiora in a tearing hurry, having driven from Ruatoki via Murupara and a back road to Taupo and Napier, and he and Pauline had an appointment not long after. He was in failing health.

	Kara Puketapu			M					Kara		Puketapu			his home		Kara Puketapu	Kara Puketapu was chosen by Te Ati Awa as their speaker, and uses a strong Taranaki accent with silent Hs. I discussed with him whether he should make some concession to the previous occupants of Wellington Harbour, Ngati Ira and Ngai Tara. He said "We'll see how it goes" or words to that effect. He made some effort to aspirate "Hātaitai", but the effect is uncomfortable.
	Kath Hemi			F					Kath		Hemi			Omaka marae		Kath Hemi	
	Kelly Davis			M					Kelly		Davis			his home		Kelly Davis	
	Kepa Tanirau			M					Kepa		Tanirau			his home		Kepa Tanirau	
	Koro Tawa			M					Koro		Tawa			his home		Koro Tawa	
	Lee Luke			M					Lee		Luke			his home		Lee Luke	
	Lena Manuel			F					Lena		Manuel			her home		Lena Manuel	Lena Manuel was a stalwart of the Māori Women's Welfare League, and I had met her in that context in Wellington, but in the event we recorded in her home in Wairoa. I always had an uphill job persuading women to speak. My standard line was that women needed to know about placenames in composing waiata. I now wish I had worked harder at it.
	Maaka Jones			F					Maaka		Jones			her home		Maaka Jones	
	Maarire Goodall			M	Dr				Maarire		Goodall			Studio 1, Broadcasting House, Bowen St, Wellington		Maarire Goodall	Sir Tīpene O'Regan directed me to Maarire Goodall when I began the South Island. He was invaluable, pointing me towards most of the speakers and taking over the production of the third print volume. We were both strong-willed but eventually resolved all problems. In the course of this, he became a dear friend.
	Maehe P H Nikora			M				Maehe Nikora	Maehe	P H	Nikora			Studio 1, Broadcasting House, Bowen St, Wellington		Maehe Nikora	
	Aunt Magda Walscott			F	Aunt			Magda Walscott	Magda		Walscott			her home		Magda Walscott	Magda Walscott was a very senior kuia of her region, but very bright.

	Matawha (Pompey) Durie			M		Pompey		Matawha Durie	Matawha		Durie			his son Mason Durie's home		Matawha Durie	Mr Durie knew far more names around the family home and Aorangi marae - names for humps and dips in the land, it seemed.

	Merimeri Penfold in Tane Nui a Rangi			F				Merimeri Penfold	Merimeri		Penfold		Tane Nui a Rangi	Tane Nui a Rangi		Merimeri Penfold	Merimeri was my first tutor of Māori, a great scholar of the language, and a beautiful speaker. She helped update Williams' Dictionary, and translated some of Shakespeare's sonnets into Māori. In 1970 she composed a haka against apartheid. It is my eternal regret that when I asked her to record her Far North names, she brought a male speaker with her, and I let her defer to him, so we only hear her say the names that he missed. I resolved to make a greater effort to include women in the South Island section.
	Mita Mohi			M					Mita		Mohi			Rangiwewehi Pā		Mita Mohi	Mita Mohi is better known as a teacher of the taiaha.

	Pukerau Rangitutea in the porch of Hoturoa			M				Pukerau Rangitutea	Pukerau		Rangitutea		The porch of Hoturoa	The porch of Hoturoa		Pukerau Rangitutea	The first recording, at his home in the evening, was a technical disaster for some reason, and I went back later, in the morning, and our recording on the meeting house porch was much more successful. Like many others, he showed his dedication to this project by agreeing undergo the tedious process of recording the names clearly and without background noise, not once but twice.
	Punia (Molly) Hotene			F			Molly	Punia Hotene	Punia		Hotene			her home		Punia Hotene	
	Rakiihia Tau			M					Rakiihia		Tau			his home		Rakiihia Tau

	Rawakata Perenara			M					Rawakata		Perenara			his home		Rawakata Perenara	
	Rex Hiakita			M					Rex		Hiakita			his home		Rex Hiakita	When I visited Rex Hiakita, he was hesitant, but a would-be rangatira  from another area (with a very poor outline of a facial moko), said "Give me your machine, I'll record your names." Knowing enough not to say "No" outright, I said "Taihoa" and came back to Mr Hiakita later. 
	Robert Keepa			M					Robert		Keepa			his home		Robert Keepa	
	Ross Gregory			M					Ross		Gregory			his home		Ross Gregory	
	Ru Kotua			M					Ru		Kotua		a field near Takapau	a field near Takapau		Ru Kotua	Ru Kotua initially baulked at recording the names when I showed him a list written in the double-vowel orthography. He wanted nothing to do with it. The first volume was entirely so written in the first instance, and the double vowels were laboriously converted to macrons by the incredibly patient Radio NZ typing pool. When I showed Mr Kotua the version with macrons, he thought they were the greatest thing since sliced bread and all objection evaporated. The recording, outside in a field near Takapau, went happily with birds chirping in the background.
	Ruka Broughton			M					Ruka		Broughton			his office, Victoria University of Wellington		Ruka Broughton	
	Sam Toia			M				Sam Toia	Sam		Toia					Sam Toia	Possibly misidentified as his brother Hohepa
	Sonny Waru in Stratford Park			M					Sonny		Waru		Stratford Park	Stratford Park		Sonny Waru	Recording western Taranaki was a tossup between Sony Waru and Huirangi Waikerpuru.I didn't know when I chose Sonny Waru that he was only affiliated to Taranaki through Pariʰaka. (His first name, Taniwharau, gives away his Waikato origin.) Nonetheless he has lived there so long his accent is fully Taranaki.

	Te Aputa ki Wairua Parata Kauri			F					Te Aputa ki Wairua	Parata	Kauri			her home		Te Aputa ki Wairua Kauri	Mrs Kauri smoked constantly and was short of breath throughout the recording. (She died soon after.) You can hear her pride when she says her ancestor's name, Wi Parata.

	Te Mahinga Peter White			M			Peter		Te Mahinga		White			his home		Te Mahinga White

	Te Rino Tirikatene			M					Te Rino		Tirikatene			his office		Te Rino Tirikatene	Rino Tirikātene was a son of Sir Eruera Tirikātene MP and a brother of Whetū Tirikātene-Sullivan MP. He died while standing for Parliament himself, and his son Rino took the seat. He had no tribal affiliation to the Marton region, but was the best possible person to say the names of the many buildings at Rātana.

	Tupi Puriri			M					Tupi		Puriri			his home		Tupi Puriri	
	Turi Elkington			M					Turi		Elkington			his home		Turi Elkington	Finding a speaker for Nelson proved difficult, but I had been introduced to Mr Elkington in Waipukurau when I was recording in that area. He had already been enthusiastic for the project, though of course he declined to speak the names so far from his home, so I had no hesitation in going back to him.

	Wiremu Parker			M		Bill			Wiremu		Parker			his home		Wiremu Parker	Wiremu Parker was a pioneer of Māori broadcasting. He coined the term 'te reo irirangi' for radio.
