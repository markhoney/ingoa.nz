lowernorth	1	Lower North Island	Te Upoko o te Ika	1	1984-10-01	1984-11-01	1985-05-01	4000	Bill Toft Memorial grant	Two cassettes (90 minutes each)	Names of the North Island, south of a line running from the mouth of the Rangitaiki river, north of Lake Taupo, to the mouth of the Mokau river.	I typed the first part at home on an electric typewriter, and the incredibly patient Radio NZ typing pool put up with my micromanagement for over a year. They put the lists on to 8" IBM floppy discs. In the first instance, I used double vowel orthography (Maaori) as I had learnt from Professor Bruce Biggs at Auckland University. It became clear that - largely under the influence of Professor Tīmoti Kāretu at Waikato University - the macron (Māori) was going to win out, and we searched and replaced all 10 vowels (AA EE II OO UU aa ee ii oo uu) with their macronned equivalents - <i>then</i> searched and de-maronned all the wrongly alteredEnglish words such as schōl and mēting. Creating macrons was a job in itself in those days. Each one involved making a subroutine, or macro, of backspace, half-raise, hyphen, half-lower. Before I went out recording, I asked for printouts of the names, but invariably more would have to be added on the road.	The first volume was entirely recorded on a Uher portable reel-to-reel recorder at 7 1/2 inches/second.. At the outset I insisted on using the only stereo recorder of Radio NZ Special Projects, when it was free. I knew that the sound quality would be substantially better in stereo, even though it was only ever a single voice. I made various short forays to southern parts of the North Island, and two big sweeps over several days into Wʰanganui, Taranaki, Taupo, the Urewera, East Coast and Hawkes Bay.
uppernorth	2	Upper North Island	Te Hiku o te Ika	1	1986-01-01	1990-01-01	1991-04-01	14000		Two cassettes (70 minutes each)	Names of the North Island, north of a line running from the mouth of the Rangitaiki river, north of Lake Taupo, to the mouth of the Mokau river. Also overseas names and some names missed from part 1.	Without a grant for the second part, I could not rely on the Radio NZ typing pool, and created the lists at home, teaching myself how to use spreadsheets, which were relatively new in 1986.	Most of the second volume was recorded on the Uher portable reel-to-reel machine, but at one point north of Auckland it broke down and I hired what had once been a top-of-the-line cassette machine. The sound quality, even though I think it had Dolby noise reduction, was decidedly inferior. I completed the Bay of Plenty before mid-1988 and made several long hauls into the King Country, Waikato-Hauraki, Auckland and Northland in 1989-1990.
south	3	South Island	Te Wai Pounamu	2	1992-11-01	1993-04-01	1994-11-01	5000	NZ Lottery Board Heritage Fund and Pacific Conservation and Development Trust	Two cassettes (45 minutes and 55 minutes)	Names of the South Island, Stewart Island and southern islands, and the Chatham Islands.	Again I created the lists at home, but this time I transmitted them to Dr Maarire Goodall's computer using a precursor of the Internet, a dailup dating service called the Meetboard. At 300 Baud (bits/second), that took hours, and the issues of encoding and decoding the macrons in ASCII were horrendous.	The third volume was entirely recorded on Digital Audio Tape (DAT), like a tiny VCR. The improvement in sound quality is evident. I visited the South Island three times altogether, travelling as far as Tākaka, Hokitika and Tuatāpere.
